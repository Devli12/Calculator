# Calculator with Graphical User Interface (GUI)

This is a simple calculator program in Python that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations. The calculator allows you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers interactively using buttons.

## Features

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Clear (C)
- Equal (=) to evaluate the expression

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.x) installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `calculator.py` file is located.
4. Run the calculator script using the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Using the Calculator

1. A graphical window will appear, showing the calculator interface.
2. Click on the buttons to enter numbers and perform calculations.
3. Use the numeric buttons (0-9) for input.
4. Use the arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
5. Press the "C" button to clear the input.
6. Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result in the Entry widget.

## Example

Suppose you want to calculate the result of the expression "2 + 3 * 5." Here's how you would do it using the calculator:

1. Click on the "2" button.
2. Click on the "+" button.
3. Click on the "3" button.
4. Click on the "*" button.
5. Click on the "5" button.
6. Click on the "=" button.

The result "17" will be displayed in the Entry widget.

## Note

- The calculator uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the expressions entered by the user. While it works for simple calculations, avoid using this method for more complex or sensitive operations.

## Enjoy Calculating!
